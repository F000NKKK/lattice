## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Repository bootstrap: workspace `Cargo.toml`, licensing, community health
  files, and GitHub configuration.
- `net-lattice-core`: `Error`, `PlatformErrorCode`, and `Id<T>`.
- `net-lattice-ip`: `Ipv4Address`/`Ipv6Address`, `Ipv4Network`/`Ipv6Network`,
  `Ipv4PrefixLength`/`Ipv6PrefixLength`.
- `net-lattice-model`: the `route` module (`Route`, `RouteId`, `IpAddress`,
  `Network`).
- `net-lattice-platform`: `RouteProvider` and `Capability`, with no
  dependency on `net-lattice-model`.
- `net-lattice-backend-linux`: `RouteProvider` implementation via Netlink
  (`rtnetlink`), gated to `target_os = "linux"`.
- `net-lattice` facade: `LatticeBackend`, `Lattice<B>`, and
  `Lattice::connect()` (Linux default).
- `scripts/release.sh` and `scripts/gh_release.sh` for versioning,
  publishing, and tagging workspace crates.

This is Stage 0.1 of [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)'s Incremental
Delivery Plan: listing, adding, and removing IPv4/IPv6 routes on Linux.
